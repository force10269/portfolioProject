# My Portfolio

## Background

This is my personal portfolio website which showcases my experience, projects, and general design skill to potential employers. Deployed on `korrytunnicliff.com`, this website is designed to be responsive!

## Technical Information

The website is built using the following technologies:
- HTML and CSS
- React.js as the front-end framework
- Bootstrap as the CSS framework
- EmailJS for sending emails from the contact form

To run the website locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal window in the project directory and run `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by performing `cp .env.sample .env` and then fill in the corresponding variables for use with EmailJS
5. Run `yarn serve` to start the server
6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Credits

The website was designed and developed by Korry Tunnicliff using the following resources:
